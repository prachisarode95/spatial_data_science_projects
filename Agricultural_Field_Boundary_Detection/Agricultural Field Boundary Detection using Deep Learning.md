## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fully automated workflow to detect agricultural field boundaries using high-resolution **Sentinel-2 imagery** and **OpenStreetMap farmland labels**, combined with a **U-Net based semantic segmentation model**. It is tailored to highlight my applied geospatial and machine learning skills for real-world agricultural monitoring tasks.

**Key Objective**:  
To build an end-to-end pipeline that extracts field-level parcel boundaries from satellite imagery, enabling downstream applications such as crop type mapping, yield analysis, and precision agriculture.

## üéØ Why this Project?

Manual delineation of field boundaries is time-consuming and inconsistent across regions. This project showcases how **remote sensing data** combined with **deep learning** can automate boundary detection with scalability and precision ‚Äî a highly sought-after skill in agriculture, climate tech, and geospatial AI roles.

## üöÄ Project Workflow

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Data Acquisition (Completed)
- Downloaded Sentinel-2 imagery via Google Earth Engine Python API.
- Extracted farmland polygons from OpenStreetMap using `osmnx` and `geopandas`.

### Phase 2: Image‚ÄìMask Dataset Preparation (In progress)
- Clipped Sentinel-2 RGB composite to farmland AOI.
- Rasterized farmland polygons to binary masks.
- Generated 512√ó512 image‚Äìmask tile pairs with proper padding for model input.

### Phase 3: Model Training (Planned)
- Training a U-Net model on image‚Äìmask tiles using `TensorFlow/Keras`.
- Will evaluate performance using accuracy, IoU (Intersection-over-Union), and F1 score.

### Phase 4: Post-Processing & Vectorization (Planned)
- Convert predicted masks to vector shapefiles.
- Clean boundaries using morphological operations.
- Evaluate spatial overlap with ground truth polygons.

### Phase 5: Visualization & Deployment (Planned)
- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize results.
- Deploy via Streamlit on Hugging Face Spaces or GEE App.
