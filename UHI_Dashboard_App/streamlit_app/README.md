# 🌆 Climate-Resilient Urban Planning – Urban Heat Island Detection & Cooling Infrastructure Mapping

A complete end-to-end GeoAI project that identifies Urban Heat Island (UHI) hotspots and maps cooling infrastructure in **Pune, India**, using **Python with Geospatial Technology**. The goal is to support climate-adaptive urban planning during the **pre-monsoon season (March–May 2024)**.

## 🔍 Features

✅ Visualize Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat 9  
✅ Display parks, gardens, rivers, and lakes from OpenStreetMap  
✅ Identify cooling buffer zones (200m radius)  
✅ Recommend interventions in hotspot areas with limited cooling access  
✅ Built entirely with open-source Python tools

## 🛰️ Data Sources

- **LST**: Landsat 9 Level-2 Thermal Band 10 (Mar–May 2024)
- **Cooling Infrastructure**: OpenStreetMap (parks, gardens, water bodies)
- **Boundary**: Pune Municipal Limits (OpenStreetMap)

## 📌 How to Use This App

- 🗺️ **Toggle map layers** using the sidebar to explore thermal hotspots, green spaces, water bodies, and cooling buffer zones.
- 🔍 **Zoom and pan** the interactive map to inspect specific neighborhoods or zones within Pune.
- 📊 **Analyze spatial patterns** between heat intensity and lack of cooling infrastructure.
- 📌 **Review recommendations** at the bottom of the app for proposed urban cooling strategies.
- 💡 This dashboard is designed for urban planners, climate researchers, and civic authorities interested in data-driven urban heat mitigation.
