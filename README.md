# 🗺️ Spatial Data Science Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of **Spatial Data Science Projects** — a living repository where I combine geospatial analysis, data storytelling, and modern Python visualization tools to tackle real-world spatial problems.

This repo is part of my journey to transition into a professional role in **Spatial Data Science**, while applying my background in GIS, Remote Sensing, and Geospatial Data Integration & Automation.

> 🔍 **Focus:** Urban analytics, Environmental Monitoring, Accessibility Mapping, Land Use Change, Air Quality Visualization & more.
> 💻 **Stack:** Python · Streamlit · GeoPandas · Kepler.gl · GEE · Plotly · Leafmap · OSMnx and more.
